## Apache Spark for Azure Synapse:
Apache Spark is an open-source, memory-optimized system for managing big data workloads, It is used when you require a Spark engine for big data processing or data science, and you don’t mind that there is no service level agreement provided to keep the services running. 

Usually it is of interest of open-source professionals. The reason for Apache Spark is to overcome the limitations of what was known as SMP systems for big data workloads.

## Azure HDInsight (HDI):

This implementation is usually of interest to open-source professionals who required an SLA, and data platform experts experienced with Microsoft products and services.

## Azure Databricks:
Azure Databricks is a managed Apache Spark-as-a-Service propriety solution that provides an end-to-end data engineering/data science platform. Azure Databricks is of interest for many data engineers and data scientists working on big data projects today. It provides the platform in which you can create and manage the big data/data science projects all on one platform.

These services are not mutually exclusive. It is common to find customers who use a combination of these technologies working together.
